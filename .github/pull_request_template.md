### Not Accepting Pull Requests

We cannot accept pull requests on these spec files. Please file an Issue if you have questions, suggestions or feedback.

Our open Web API specification is an artifact. It's the end result of an incredible machine (well, a Python script) compiling all the facts, fibs, schemas, and articulated examples across hundreds of individual files that describe our platform internally. As a result and at this time, we will not be accepting contributions to this repo.
